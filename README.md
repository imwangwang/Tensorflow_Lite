## Deploy to Omnichip2
The following instructions will help you build and deploy this sample to [Omnichip2 development kits](https://www.zglue.com/products/devkit).

### Pre-requisites
Install Mbed CLI from [here](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.15/tools/installation-and-setup.html)

Install nRF Command Line Tools from [here](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools)

### Build project
Run commands from Tensorflow_Lite/magic_wand/mbed/
```
mbed config root .
mbed deploy
mbed compile -m NRF52_DK -t GCC_ARM
```

### Program firmware


Run commands from Tensorflow_Lite/magic_wand/mbed/BUILD/NRF52_DK/GCC_ARM/
```
nrfjprog --program mbed.hex --sectorerase
nrfjprog -r
```

Open a serial terminal (e.g. Tera Term) with the following settings:
- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bit
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1 bit
- Flow Control: none

You will then see the following message:
